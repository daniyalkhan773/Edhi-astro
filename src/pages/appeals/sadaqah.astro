              In Islamic tradition, Sadaqah meaning is the voluntary giving of
              alms or charity, viewed as a moral obligation and an act of
              worship. It serves to purify wealth and strengthen faith. Sadaqah
              manifests in various forms, including donating money to charities,
              aiding the needy, or feeding the hungry. This practice of sadaqah
              meaning, rooted in Islamic teachings for centuries, is a vital
              aspect of leading a virtuous life.

                  Sadaqah refers to any selfless act of kindness without

                  hand, is a lasting form of kindness, a gesture that keeps
                  giving even after you're no longer present.
