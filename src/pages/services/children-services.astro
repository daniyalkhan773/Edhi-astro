            At many Edhi emergency centers, we have baby cradles called

            are then taken into our care and provided shelter in Edhi Homes.
            Over time, more people have come to accept this service, and some
            even bring babies directly to our centers. We carefully assess and
            select suitable families for adoption, ensuring the well-being of
            the child. <br /><br /> Bilquis Edhi oversees this process, ensuring
            that adopting parents are suitable and conducting regular follow-ups.
            Babies found abandoned in garbage dumps around Karachi are brought to
            our central nursery for medical care before adoption. We keep all records
            confidential to protect the child's privacy.

            The Edhi Child Adoption Centre and childcare services began in 1949.
            Mrs. Bilquis Edhi oversees the care and feeding of babies and
            children. Cradles are placed outside all Edhi Centres across the
            country to keep abandoned and illegitimate babies safe. These babies
            are often given to childless couples after a careful screening
            process to ensure they are suitable for adoption. Bilquis Edhi
            thoroughly reviews the backgrounds of the couples before deciding if
            they are a good fit for adoption.
