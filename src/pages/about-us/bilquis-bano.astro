          Bilquis Bano Edhi's journey of helping people started when she became
          a nurse at the Edhi Nurses Training Centre in 8th grade. When she
          married Abdul Sattar Edhi in 1966, they both decided to help others.
          Even though they didn't have much money, they began their work to help
          poor people in Pakistan. They started the famous Edhi Foundation to
          continue their mission.

          and her husband also got the 1986 Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public

          in Pakistan. They have hospitals and places for emergency care, where

            One of Bilquis Edhi's primary responsibilities involves overseeing
            the adoption process for children under the Edhi Foundation's care.
            She looks after the process when families want to adopt these kids.
            She makes sure that the families wishing to adopt are stable and
            committed. If a child has a disability, Bilquis makes sure they find
            a lovely home at the foundation, where they will get lots of care
            and support for their whole life.

            having enough good buildings and electricity issues are big
            challenges. But, they are determined to make things better for
            people in Pakistan. They want to work with other countries and keep
            coming up with new ideas to make Pakistan's help services as good as
            the ones in other places. They dream of a time when Pakistan's help
            for people is just as good as it is in other countries.
