          Every society is destined to face the problems of looking after
              the welfare of the sick, the weak, the destitute and the needy.
              All societies are alike in this respect. One way of assessing the
              status of a society on the road to civilization is the value
              accorded to an individual and his basic human needs. <br /><br
              />These have not always received the attention they deserve in the
              planning of economics, particularly in developing countries. Most
              of the available resources are consumed by defense needs and
              pressing demands for technological progress. <br /><br />Programs
              for development in the social sector remain a long way behind,
              mainly because of financial constraints. Special efforts are,
              therefore, needed to mobilize community resources to initiate and
              develop programs for the welfare of the weak and the disadvantaged
              members of society.

            A. Sattar Edhi has spent over 45 years of his life in the service of
            humanity. He as established, more or less single handedly, a
            national welfare network, the Edhi Foundation (EF), which operates
            from a small headquarter, in a poor locality of Karachi. <br /><br
            /> The simplicity of central office is amazing in view of the wide range
            of the nation-wide services co-ordinated by Edhi personally with the
            help of telephones and a handful of assistants. It is, therefore, not
            easy to manage the strange mixture of complexity of operations and use
            of administrative communication channels with the limited staff. This
            has inevitably resulted in the centralisation of policy decisions. <br
            /><br />However, with the general spread of the services to all
            parts of the country and an increasing awareness of the public, the
            way has been paved for greater involvement of communities in the
            management of welfare services. Edhi displays a remarkable stamina
            and energy at the advanced age of seventy to keep himself informed
            about all activities of the Foundation in all parts of Pakistan. He
            travels in Pakistan and abroad extensively for this purpose and
            conveys a feeling of being there, when needed.

              People lovingly call him "Abbu" or "Nana" because of the care he
              provides. He is not a typical person – he didn't go to school to
              learn about helping others. But he learned a lot on his own and
              became really good at helping people practically. Many admire him
