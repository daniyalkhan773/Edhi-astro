            I only knew the Edhis as my parents, not knowing who my real parents
            were since I was introduced to the Edhi Centre when I was just 2
            years old. My memories are faint, but I recall someone bringing me
            to the center. I've lived happily at the Edhi Centre ever since.
            Despite efforts by the Edhi organization to find my biological
            parents, they were unsuccessful. Now, at 27 years old, my life
            revolves around the Edhi Foundation. Mr. Abdul Sattar Edhi and Mrs.
            Bilqees Edhi have been like parents to me. I'm immensely grateful
            for their care and support during my time at the Edhi Centre. <br
            /><br /> Thanks to them, I am now married and have a daughter. The Edhi
            organization never let me feel alone; they provided warmth and affection
            always. I'm unable to fully express my gratitude for their kindness and
            assistance.

          <p class="mt-1 text-sm text-black">
            Khurram Shezad and Amir, both are part of Edhi foundation, ever
            since they entered into the Edhi Centre. Both of them are suffering
            from the disabilities like deaf and dumb. Both children were given
            education at Edhi Foundation. They initiated their social and
            practical lives after acquiring technical skills at Edhi
            organization. <br /><br /> During the process of learning at Edhi Foundation,
            we found both highly hard working, and their iron works indicated their
            sense of responsibility. Both have married to the unclaimed girls â€“ living
            in the Edhi homes. Thus both of them are living with far more happiness
            and satisfaction with their wives in Edhi Foundation.

            In 1989, after my father passed away, I felt alone and struggled to
            cope. Despite my efforts, I couldn't overcome my difficulties, so I
            decided to seek help from the Edhi Foundation. Since then, my
            relationship with the foundation has grown, and I am now truly
            grateful for the support and care provided by Uncle Edhi. <br /><br
            /> His kindness makes me feel like I'm with family, and I can't thank
            him enough. May Allah bless Uncle Edhi with even more success and happiness.
